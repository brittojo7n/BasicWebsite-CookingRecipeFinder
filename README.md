## Assignment on HTML & CSS: A cooking recipe page

HTML contains all for the page, which involve headings, images, lists, and text blocks.

CSS dictates the interface and the layout such as: colors, font, spacing, or positioning (like Flexbox: place the image next to the text).

These two collaborate in creating a well-structured, styled, and ultimately, a beautiful website.
